**Project Title:**
Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

---

## 1. Introduction

Access to credit is an essential factor for economic growth, enabling individuals and companies to invest, purchase goods, and foster development. However, granting loans involves significant risks for financial institutions, especially regarding defaults.

This project aims to develop Machine Learning models to predict whether a customer is eligible for a loan, using historical customer data and their financial behavior.

The proposed solution can be applied by banks, fintechs, and credit unions to support more assertive decision-making, reducing risks and increasing efficiency in the approval process.

**Notes:**

* The dataset shows imbalanced classes, with more customers not eligible for loans.
* Missing values were found in some variables.

## 5. Data Preprocessing

Steps performed:

1. **Missing value handling:** Replaced with mean, median, or removed depending on the column.
2. **Categorical encoding:** Applied Label Encoding.
3. **Normalization:** Applied StandardScaler to numerical variables.
4. **Train-test split:** 70% training / 30% testing using `train_test_split` with a fixed `random_state` for reproducibility.

---

## 6. Models Tested

The following algorithms were tested:

* Logistic Regression
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with log and hinge loss
* Random Forest Classifier
* Extra Trees Classifier

---

## 7. Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* AUC-ROC
* Precision-Recall Curve for threshold analysis

## 8. Results

**Example â€“ Logistic Regression (Colab):**

* Accuracy: 0.8031
* Precision: 0.2467
* Recall: 0.3383
* F1-Score: 0.2853
* AUC-ROC: 0.6770

**Example â€“ Logistic Regression (Local Jupyter):**

* Accuracy: 0.7311
* Precision: 0.2255
* Recall: 0.5405
* F1-Score: 0.3183
* AUC-ROC: 0.7123

**Note:** Differences between local and Colab results can be explained by variations in library versions, `random_state` configurations, or preprocessing differences.

## 9. Hyperparameter Tuning

RandomizedSearchCV was used to optimize hyperparameters for Random Forest and Extra Trees models, aiming to reduce search time and find promising parameter combinations.

---

## 10. Visualizations

Generated visual outputs:

* Confusion Matrix for each model.
* ROC Curves.
* Precision-Recall Curves highlighting the optimal threshold based on F1-score.

---

## 11. Conclusion

The project demonstrated that performance varies depending on the algorithm and parameter tuning.
Although Random Forest achieved a better balance between Recall and AUC-ROC, simpler models such as Logistic Regression still delivered competitive performance with higher interpretability.

## 12. Next Steps

* Explore feature engineering techniques.
* Test boosting-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).
* Implement stratified cross-validation.
* Deploy the final model via API or Streamlit.
